;;;; src/keymap.lisp -- which key runs which command, and the switches.
;;;;
;;;; ONE table, read by every front end.  A key spec is a STRING, in the
;;;; notation an Emacs user already knows: "(" ")" "\"" "Backspace", and
;;;; "C-k" "M-(" "C-)" "C-M-f" for the chords.  A binding's value is the name of
;;;; a function in src/paredit.lisp.
;;;;
;;;; Strings rather than a structure, because the table is meant to be edited by
;;;; hand -- at the listener's own prompt, or in init.lisp -- and
;;;; (setf (paredit-key "C-)") 'slurp-forward) is the whole interface.  The
;;;; front ends parse the specs; nothing else needs to.
;;;;
;;;; A bare character spec is a key that would otherwise type that character:
;;;; those go through the toolkit's text-insertion path, where the character is
;;;; visible.  Chords go through the key-command path.  PAREDIT-SELF-INSERT-KEY-P
;;;; is which is which, and the front ends divide their work on it.
